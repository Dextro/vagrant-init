Description
===========

A template for provisioning any new [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/)
project that will will install a core set of useful packages as well as
personal dotfiles. It uses [Chef Solo](http://vagrantup.com/docs/provisioners/chef_solo.html)
and includes support for using [`knife`](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Knife)
commands with the local _cookbooks/_ directory.

The installed packages include:

* ack
* curl
* dkms
* git
* lsof
* tmux
* vim
* zsh (dotfiles are bash at the moment)

This is all based on [the vagrant-init of Aaron Bull Schaefer](https://raw.github.com/elasticdog/vagrant-init).

Usage
=====

I'll only use Debian, so the Vagrant box is a Debian Squeeze 64-bit base box.
If it is not already available, it will download a fresh and blank base box
I made myself.
You can easily replace the box by a different Debian or Ubuntu base box.
Other distro's are completely untested.

    $ git clone git://github.com/Dextro/vagrant-init.git myproject
    $ cd myproject/
    $ vagrant up

Attributes
----------

Everything should be customized based on your requirements, as this is
only meant as a initial template.

All of the included packages are specified in the `vagrant_main`
cookbook's default recipe, so start there if you want to make changes.

`knife` Metadata
----------------

When using the `knife` command, the contents of the generated cookbook
README and metadata files are configurable by editing _&lt;myproject&gt;/.chef/knife.rb_.
See `knife cookbook create --help` for details.

Requirements
============

Platform
--------

* Debian
* Ubuntu

User
----

The recipes currently assume that your VM is using the standard `vagrant`
user with a home directory of _/home/vagrant_.
